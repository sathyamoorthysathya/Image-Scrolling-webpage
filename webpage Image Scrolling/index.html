            <p>
                Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare citadel discoverted high in the Andes mountains above the Peruvian Sacred 
                Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact, featuring evidence of foemer plazas, temples, agricultural
                terraces and homes. The Incas abandoned the site a century later and it remained hidden for millennia, before being brought to public

            <h1>The Colosseum, Rome, Italy</h1>
            <p>
                The colosseum is the great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome where gladiators once fought for their life. The largest amphitheater
                ever built, it was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from AD72 to AD80. The colossal structure could hold 80,000 spectators,
                arranged in a circular ring around the central stage. Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events took place here, not just gladiatoral games,
                but also executions. So it stands to reason it would make the list of today's seven wonders of the world.
